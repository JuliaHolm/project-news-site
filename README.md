# News Site

This is my first project.
It's a made-up K-POP news magazine (with a lot of Lorem ipsum..lol).
I wanted to keep it clean and show big pictures.

## The problem

I could not keep my CSS organized. I also feel like I just jumped right into the project, I should not have done that because it made me throw it away and redo it MANY times, both the code and design.
