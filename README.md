# News Site

This is my first project.
It's a made-up K-POP news magazine (with a lot of Lorem ipsum..lol).
I wanted to keep it clean and show big pictures.

## The problem

At first, I jumped right into the project and started working on the HTML and CSS, both at the same time. I don’t even know how many files I threw away because I became completely lost or wasn’t happy with what I had done.

It took a while for me but I decided to take a different path and that was Figma. At first I didn’t like Figma (at all) and struggled a lot to visualise the webpage. After a few days I was so into it that I lost myself in the design, it was really fun. 
But now I came upon the real problem. How was I suppose to turn this into code? I noticed that I had made it too complicated (at where I’m at right now) and got frustrated that I couldn’t get it to be responsive the way I planned. At the end, I had to break free from my original plan and I finally managed to finish the project.

Through out the project I watched so many videos but sometimes I couldn’t find the answer to my ideas that I wanted to make, anywhere. So I look forward to learn more so that I can be the one finding and make the answers myself.
